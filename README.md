I laid everything out so users move smoothly from left to right. First, they see their progress in the sidebar, then they scan skip sizes in the middle, and finally they dive into the details on the right. That “progress → browse → choose” rhythm keeps the flow predictable and stress-free.

I leaned on card-based design to tie all the elements together. Each skip option and the detail panel share the same rounded corners and soft shadows, so nothing feels out of place. I also paired icons with labels—like the little calendar for hire period or the bin for waste type—so people can digest information at a glance.

To help power users, I put search and filter controls right at the top. You can jump straight to “road-legal” or “heavy waste” skips without endless scrolling. And when you click a card, the detail panel updates instantly—no full page reload—so you never lose your spot.

Under the hood, I built this on a tight design system: 8px spacing, shared React/Tailwind components, and ARIA roles to keep everything accessible. My goal was to strike a balance between clarity, cohesion, and that human touch that makes booking a skip feel… well, a little friendlier.
